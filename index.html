        <h2>Question 1: Does frequency of voting change with income and education levels?</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><i>Parallel Categories Plot</i></h3></div>
        <iframe src="categories.html" width="90%" height="80%" frameBorder="0"> </iframe>
        <p> By observing the parallel categories plot, there are some evident relationships between voting 
            frequency and income/education. With little math, it shows that <b>about 46% of voters who always vote, 
            31% of sporadic voters, and 23% of voters who rarely/never vote have achieved college education.</b> Hence,
            those who have higher education tend to care more about voting. That being said, it is hard to find a clear 
            relationship between voting frequency and income category. There is a relationship between level of education and income. 
            <b>For each group of voters, more than half of people with college level education fall into the $75-$125k or more category.</b>
            On the other hand, more than of people with high school or less education fall within the less than $75k category.
             People with some college education tend to be distributed evenly between higher and lower incomes. 
        </p>
        <h2>Question 2: How did voter turnout and absentee voting change in Virginia General Elections from 2014 to 2022?</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><i>Bubble Plot</i></h3></div>
        <iframe src="bubble.html" width="100%" height="100%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
        <h3>Percent Turnout > 100% were observed, but removed.</h3>
        <p> Based on the bubble plot observation, the year 2020 looks different from the other years.
            In general, the year 2020 had a sharp increase in percent absentee (all localities before 2020 stayed below 40% absentee whereas most localities had above 40% absentee in 2020). 
            This was largely due to the COVID-19: a world-wide pandemic that marked its beginning in early 2020. During the pandemic, people were quarantined at home and extremely cautious of contacting others.
            Hence, people preferred absentee ballots instead of on-site votings that could potentially increase the risk of being infected by the virus. 
            Creating separate plots for each year would have been easier for viewers to determine that the year 2020 was different. 
            With animation frames, viewers have to manually compare different plots by navigating the years. 
            The comparison is difficult because viewers must rely on their memory of the previous plot to compare with the current displayed.
            Therefore, showing separate plots for all years simultaneously will enable easier comparisons for the viewer.

        <h2>Question 3: What geographic trends in voter turnout are revealed by the map? Explain based on what you see in your visualization.</h2>
        <div style="text-align: center;"><h3><i>Choropleth Map</i></h3></div>
        <iframe src="map.html" width="100%" height="80%" frameBorder="0"></iframe>
        <p> In general, the choropleth reveals that localities in West Virginia tend to have lower voter turnouts than those localities in the east. 
            Specifically, the middle east part of Virginia tends to have higher voter turnouts since the regions in the choropleth map have darker red color. 
            Also, Northern Virginia also has a high voter turnouts.
